This is an example repo to demonstrate the confusing relationship between `assetPrefix` and `pathPrefix` and it's connection to a MDX "bug"

```
yarn
yarn build --prefix paths && yarn serve
```

Once you have the server running, check out http://localhost:9000/ and your shell output for details of the issue.
