### The "bug"

[This link](/link/) should be `<a href="/link/">...</a>` based on the markdown it is given, but it actually `<a href="https://example.com/_assets/link/">...</a>`. While one would expect the `href` value to simply pass through, the MDX plugin is prepending the full path. The initial instinct is to dismiss this as an MDX issue, but it's just a symptom. The "bug", so to speak, happens because the MDX plugin prefixes absolute urls with the `pathPrefix` value, which — presumably erroneously — includes the value of `assetPrefix`.

### The cause

In this site, `assetPrefix` is set to `https://example.com/_assets/`. There is no value for `pathPrefix` set. One would expect `pathPrefix` to be an empty string.

In the console of your shell, you will see the `pathPrefix` value is printed. The `pathPrefix` includes the value of `assetPrefix`. Based on the nomenclature, this seems backwards, as one would assume `pathPrefix` would refer to all paths while `assetPrefix` only applies to asset paths. Thus, one might expect that a value of `pathPrefix` might appear within `assetPrefix` but not the other way around.

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query {
    site {
      assetPrefix
      pathPrefix
    }
  }
`;
